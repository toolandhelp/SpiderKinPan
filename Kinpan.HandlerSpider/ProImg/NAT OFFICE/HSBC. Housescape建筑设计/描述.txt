Clearly defined volumetric structures are placed into the fluid space that connects the “inside” with the “outside”, the “built” with the natural, house and landscape.、&nbsp;、The building is developed on two floors built on a single dimensional span that rules the relation of an empty and transparent space with volumes (the bedrooms – studios) that set themselves as asymmetrical lenses of an ideal telescope pointed towards the landscape and with aerial surfaces (free projected levels).、&nbsp;、The project studies and creates a bio-climatic system of volumes, transparencies, facings, shutters, covered coatings and materials.、&nbsp;、The outdoor spaces around the house take different features depending on its orientation, its level in relation to the house and existing buildings in the neighboring lots.、&nbsp;、Housescape 建筑与周边景观建立渗透关系，呈现变幻的空间。同时与周边景观的互联，能够给予房屋更大的空间感觉。、&nbsp;、现存的古老的橡树，构成了景观第一感知层。跨结构的建筑表皮，高的窗户框架，和伸入建筑室内有年代的树，颠覆传统对“家”的想法，将自然作为生活的栖息地。、房子作为室内和室外的隔层，明确定义了体积结构的变幻空间，连接“室内”和“室外”、建造与自然，房屋与景观。、&nbsp;、该项目研究并创建了一个包含透明面板、百叶窗、覆盖涂层和材料的生物气候系统。、&nbsp;、不同方位，房子室外空间有不同的特征。在同一水平方位上，关联着邻近现有的建筑物。、、
